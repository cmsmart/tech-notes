## Base 
 A base is the number of different digits or combination of digits and letters that a system of counting uses to represent numbers.

## Hash collision:

A collision or clash occurs when two different inputs to a function, typically one used to compress large data items into a smaller or fixed size, produce the same output, called (depending on the application) a hash value, checksum, fingerprint, or digest.


## Hashing:

Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string.

Hasing is not reversible:  Hash functions essentially discard information in a very deterministic way - using the modulo operator.

### Purpose of hashing
* Verification (ie compare data based on hash), for indexing, cryptographic applications, and to create hash tags

## BigO - linear

* Linear search means that you will have to iterate through the list of elements until you find the element that you were looking for.

* Generally, we could say that in the worst case you will have to traverse the whole list; so it will take n iterations, where n is the number of elements on the list.

* The linear search algorithm is O(n).

## BigO - binary

* In the case of binary search, you start on the middle element of the list.

* The binary search algorithm is O(log(n))

* A prerequisite for a binary search is the data must be sorted
